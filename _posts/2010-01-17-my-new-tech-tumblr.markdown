Following in the footsteps of [Mike Champion](http://tumblr.graysky.org/) and several others from [boston.rb](http://bostonrb.org), I've decided to set up a tech tumblr account.  Basically, it's a place where I can bookmark and annotate links to content of high technical value without having to deal with the ephemeral nature of twitter or the time sink of writing a full weblog post.

Anyway, if you're interested in some of the same things I am, you may find some value in it:
