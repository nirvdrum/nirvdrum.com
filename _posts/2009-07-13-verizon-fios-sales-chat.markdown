title: Verizon FiOS Sales Chat
---

Introduction
------------

I recently moved into a new town that has Verizon FiOS services available.  I thought I would take a look into ordering FiOS for Internet at the very least and possibly for television service as well.  The Verizon site makes it rather difficult to figure out service pricing in general and, with a constant stream of promotions, it can be really hard to figure out what something is ultimately going to cost.  Against my better judgment, I decided to try Verizon's live sales chat.  What was interesting to me about this chat was the weird turn it took almost immediately.  The sales guy was very defensive about the marketing material.  This, of course, made it fun to be a bit more sarcastic in my communication.

The chat transcript appears below.  I took the liberty of collapsing separate send lines into logical paragraphs to help legibility.  Otherwise, the text is as it appeared in the chat.

Despite all this, I did end up ordering Internet service.  I hope one day to chat with Stan again.  Perhaps when I do finally decide to order TV.

The Sales Chat
--------------

We are routing you to a chat representative. Thank you for contacting Verizon. Your average wait time is 3 seconds.
You are now chatting with 'Stan'
> Stan: Hello.  Thank you for visiting our Verizon chat service. How can I help you set up your new service and save with a Verizon bundle?
>> you: Hi Stan.
>> I was just looking to order some Internet service and was shown the following text:
>> FiOS TV - Awesomely Vivid. Amazingly Real. RuleID: 40 The 100% all-digital FiOS network gives your TV screen a crystal-clear picture. Our Essentials package with 260+ channels starts at $12.99/month. Add to your online order TODAY.
>> How do I get 260+ channels for $12.99/month?
>> When I looked at the TV packages, $12.99/month only got me 15 stations.
> Stan: You can't.  The add states pricing STARTS at $12.99/month.
> That is correct.
>> you: The ad states that a package with 260+ channels starts at $12.99, yes.
> Stan: The add is advising you you can get FIOS TV starting at $12.99/month.
> The local channel package is $12.99/month.
>> you: That's just downright false advertising then.
>> The word "with" is not ambiguous.
> Stan: I will report your concerns to our web site developers.
>> you: Thanks.
>> I'm a bit annoyed I wasted time looking for a package that just doesn't exist.
>> You may want to escalate it before you guys have a legal issue on your hands.
>> There's no asterisk or anything that would qualify the ad in the manner you thought it should be read as.
> Stan: I understand.
> It is an error that will be corrected.
>> you: Alright. Well, thanks for your time. I guess I'll pass on the TV portion.
> Stan: You're welcome.  Please leave this window open in case you have any questions while you are completing the order.
> I did actually just confirm with a fellow employee that the advertisement has been reported and is set top be removed.  I apologize for the inconvenience.
>> you: Thanks.
>> And if I order this online, my price drops $5 / month?
> Stan: The $5/month discount only applies if you order a bundle that includes home phone service.
> You will get your first month free for ordering online.
>> you: Okay. That contradicts another ad I'm looking at right now.
>> "FiOS Internet Starting at $44.99 / mo. with annual agreement"
> Stan: It is $44.99/month if you also have home phone service.
>> you: This is the third ad that has been wrong for me today.
> Stan: That ad is not wrong.
>> you: Right above it is an ad for Phone + FiOS Internet.
>> This one clearly says FiOS Internet.
>> Nothing about phone service.
>> If you would like me to send you a screenshot, I can.
> Stan: I am aware of what you are seeingf.
> Fios internet pricing starts at $44.99/month.  Pricing varies whether you have home phone as well or not.
>> you: Okay. Then you're aware that there's nothing saying anything about needing phone service. No asterisk. No fine print.
> Stan: Do you see a list of terms underneath?
> You should see several paragraphs of terms and conditions.
> In there it states voice service is required.
> Pricing is higher if you do not also have home phone service with Verizon.
>> you: I'm reading it right now. Would you care to cite the specific passage?
> Stan: You should see it in that section at some point,.
> I can not quote the passage verbatim.
>> you: Yes. Because it's not there. I just read it twice.
> Stan: The key line there is STARTS AT.
>> you: Yes. And it doesn't start at that.
>> The key line is, once again, the "with" statement.
> Stan: Pricing starts at $44.99 per month.  Pricing for your specific situation is displayed once you provide your address.
>> you: And the only thing it says I need is a 1 year contract.
> Stan: The price is $49.99/month if the only service you plan to have with us is internet.
>> you: If I needed phone service, it should say "Phone + FiOS Internet", just like the other ad right above it.
> Stan: The reason the $12.99/month ad is incorrect is because it mentions a specific package.  
> That is not true either because phone + internet is not $44.99
>> you: Fair point.
>> So, we agree that there is nothing there listed for $44.99.
> Stan: Pricing starts at $44.99 per month for the internet service.  Your actual price based on your specific situation is displayed once you enter your address and we discover the services you have or do not have with us.
>> you: Okay.
>> So, somewhere, someone can get it for $44.99 / month. But, it's not me or where I live. Kinda weird, but makes more sense than the alternative.
>> I forgot how much it sucked to be a Verizon customer.
> Stan: Anyone that has phone service with Verizon can add the fios internet for $44.99/month.
>> you: Stan, 15 min. ago you told me I was reading that other ad wrong, too. And then you came back and said the ad was wrong.
> Stan: It is $44.99/month on top of their existing phone service charges.
>> you: I feel like we're heading down that same road.
> Stan: I explained why the $12.99/month ad was incorrect.
>> you: It's neither here nor there.
> Stan: It mentions a specific TV plan which is not $12.99/month
>> you: I do thank you for your time.
> Stan: Have a great weekend.
>> you: You, too.
