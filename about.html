    I'm a staff engineer at <a href="https://shopify.engineering/">Shopify</a> where I work on the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby">TruffleRuby</a> implementation of the Ruby programming language.
    I care a lot about performance and love being able to make that a core feature of dynamic language runtimes.

    I've historically been quite active in a variety of open source projects. I'm a member of the Apache Software Foundation and was an active member of the core Selenium team for several years.
    I still contribute to projects where I can, but I no longer spend the entirety of my weekends on open source projects. I've taken to 3D printing and electrical engineering, in addition to 
    playing (poorly) drums and guitar.
