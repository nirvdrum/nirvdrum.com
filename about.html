    I'm a researcher at <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/">Oracle Labs</a> where I work on the <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/truffleruby">TruffleRuby</a> implementation of the Ruby programming language.
    I care a lot about performance and love being able to make that a core feature of dynamic language runtimes.

    Previously I was the co-founder of Mogotest, the leader of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6fV-6eMSUM">Web Consistency Testing</a> approach to automated visual testing for cross-browser compatibility.
    Prior to that I was the co-founder of Servprise International, an early company in the datacenter management space.
    We designed and manufactured our own web service enabled hardware to remotely power control and monitor computer systems.

    When I have spare time, I like working on devops-related projects.
    In particular, I mantain <a href="http://rubber.io/">Rubber</a>, a server provisioning and deployment tool
    and contribute to <a href="http://fog.io/">fog</a>, a cloud services library for Ruby.

    My <a href="http://github.com/nirvdrum/">GitHub profile</a> contains most of my other OSS projects.
